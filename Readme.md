# Pair Game

```sh
Today's game is a lovely memory game, "Find the Pairs". It's very simple - you turn over one card and then try to find its matching pair.

You can choose from different sizes of boards and there are also different categories. It uses some FontAwesome's awesome fonts, and was built using Jade, Sass and vanilla JS only.
